## About

Hundreds of thousands of families world-wide struggle with the difficulties associated with raising a child with developmental disabilities.  While therapy is important, healthcare professionals cannot always be present to log data relating to behavioral incidents. Thus, the onus lies with the parents to be able to log these occurances.  There is already enough pressure on the parents of children with developmental disabilities, so there needs to be an easier, quicker way for parents to log this data.  That quicker way is here with the ABC Data Logger.

## Intro Video

Check out a short [demo](https://www.loom.com/share/ceb43bedf201465f8bec3eee151d2bbd) of the ABC Data Logger in action! 

## Features

Create a unique user profile and add cases/clients to your account. If you are logging data for an established client, the home screen will populate with a log of that child/client's past incidents, ordered from most recent to oldest.  

   # Log-in and Browse Incident History:

Then, from the convenience of the home screen select the bottom blue button to begin logging a new incident.  Incident logging takes you through a series of drop-down menus where you will select the following:

* A: Antecedent -- The cause of, or what led up to the client/child's behavior.
* B: Behavior -- What the child did, Ex: Screaming, crying, property descruction, hitting.
* C: Consequence -- What the parent/caretaker/professional did to quell the behavior.
* And finally, logging the date & time of the incident.

The new incident will then immediately populate on the incident history logs.

With an established client, the ABC Data Logger can compile incident data logs into useful graphs that make for convenient data analysis. Currently, behaviorial frequency can be viewed by month, with more graphs detailing duration and frequency currently in development.
